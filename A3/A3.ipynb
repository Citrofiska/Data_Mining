    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this homework I implemented the algrithm proposed in [TRIÃˆST: Counting Local and Global Triangles in Fully-Dynamic Streams with Fixed Memory Size](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/rfp0465-de-stefaniA.pdf) to count global triangles in a given graph dataset. The dataset can be found via the link: [HEP-TH](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ca-HepTh.html), which covers collaborations between authors papers submitted to High Energy Physics - Theory category from the e-print arXiv. In the dataset statistics we can see that the total number of triangles in this graph dataset is 28339. The goal of this homework is to generate an approximation of the number of triangles using two versions of the TRIEST algorithm that is based on reservoir sampling. "

It only maintains a sample of edges with a fixed size M that is chosen by the user, so there won't be any concerns regarding running out of memory. The sample of edges is obtained via reservoir sampling, which in each time step t>M, replaces an uniformly-chosen edge in the sample with the coming new edge with probability M/t. In this way, even if the graph is unbounded, since the sample size is fixed, the algorithm will still work well."

To support edge deletions, we could further adopt the TRIEST_FD proposed in the paper as well, which uses random pairing to extend reservoir sampling. The general idea is edge deletions will be \"compensated\" by future edge insertions and this algorithm keeps two counters to keep track of the number of uncompensated edge deletions involving an edge that was (resp. was not) in S at the time the deletion for that edge was on the stream."
